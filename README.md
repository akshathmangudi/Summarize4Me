## Overview
Extractive Summarization is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique which aims to summarize given text based on 
text input. Unlike abstractive summarization, which generates new sentences based on the input, extractive summarization
generates a summary from the sentences present from the original document to generate a summary. 

Extractive Summarization involves four main steps: 
1. Text preprocessing
2. Tokenization
3. Sentence selection
4. Summary generation

All these steps will be explained in detail in this repository.
